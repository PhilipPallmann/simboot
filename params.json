{"name":"simboot","tagline":"Simultaneous comparisons of diversity indices using R","body":"### [simboot](https://github.com/shearer/simboot)\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\nFor installation, please download the [newest R-version](http://cran.r-project.org/) for your operation system. Then use the package manager to install the [simboot package](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/simboot/index.html) or run the following command inside R:\r\n `install.packages(\"simboot\")`\r\n\r\n## Description\r\nPackage simboot provides estimation of simultaneous bootstrap and asymptotic confidence intervals for diversity indices, namely the Shannon and the Simpson index. Several pre–specified multiple comparison types are available to choose. Further user–defined contrast matrices are applicable. In addition, simboot estimates adjusted as well as unadjusted p–values for two of the three proposed bootstrap methods. Further simboot allows for comparing biological diversities of two or more groups while simultaneously testing a user-defined selection of Hill numbers of orders q, which are considered as appropriate and useful indices for measuring diversity.\r\n\r\n## Corresponding publications\r\nThe simultaneous confidence intervals for Shannon's and Simpson's indices are described and compared in the [SCfDI paper](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23401312):\r\nScherer, R., Schaarschmidt, F., Prescher, S. and Priesnitz, K. U. (2013), Simultaneous confidence intervals for comparing biodiversity indices estimated from overdispersed count data. Biom. J., 55: 246–263. doi: 10.1002/bimj.201200157\r\n\r\nThe comparison of two or more groups of observations, while simultaneously testing a user-defined selection of a number of 'true' diversity measures is published in the [Hill paper](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22934781):\r\nPallmann, P., Schaarschmidt, F., Hothorn, L.
